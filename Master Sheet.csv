PB212YB1,Dorman Smith Loadbank YB1 12 way 250A panel board PB212YB1,"The Loadbank 250 modular enclosure system is engineered to provide the unrivalled flexibility and build simplicity needed in order to produce a wide range of power distribution solutions. It consists of TP&N busbars of 400A and 800A with three different sizes of 6, 12 or 18 outgoing ways.

This range houses the incoming and outgoing devices in separate adjoining enclosures which then allows the widest range of possible circuit permutations, including oversized outgoing circuits, which can then be accommodated within a common format.

Incoming options range from 250A MCCBs to 800A switch fuses depending on the board. There is a single frame size MCCB for outgoing devices which is the YB3 frame MCCB up to 250A.

The standard finish is epoxy powder coating in light grey RAL 7035.

These power supplies are an economical alternative for applications that simply require 24Vdc without additional functions. Packaged in a flat and solid metal housing, the 787-1732 provides a output current.

ECO Power Supplies lower project and operating costs with advanced features including: LED status indication, front-panel adjustable output voltage, efficiency levels up to 82% and maintenance-free CAGE CLAMP® terminations.

Fast and Safe Connection
CAGE CLAMP® Spring Pressure Connection Technology provides fast, vibration-free and maintenance-free termination of solid, finestranded or ferruled conductors.

Fast Installation
All ECO Power Supplies have a flat and very robust DIN rail mount metal housing. Mounting is simple, thanks to a readily accessible plate on the device.

Clear Indication
All ECO Power Supplies indicate output voltage availability via green LED. A red LED indicates an overvoltage. This simplifies start-up and quickly provides maintenance personnel with system or machine status.

High Load-Carrying Capacity
ECO Power Supplies detect overload from 1.15x nominal output current. The units can be overloaded up to 1.4x the nominal current. The output voltage is considerably reduced if the overload continuous rising. In case of a low-resistance short-circuit, the output will be switched off. As soon as the short circuit has been removed, the output will automatically reactivate.

Universal Supply
The wide range of input voltages ECO Power Supplies allows feeds of 85 to 264Vac  mass-produced machines can operate on different supply networks in Europe, America or Asia without additional conversion or setting. This feature increases tolerance of voltage fluctuations within a supply network, increasing reliability.

Fast and Safe Connection
CAGE CLAMP® Spring Pressure Connection Technology provides fast, vibration-free and maintenance-free termination of solid, finestranded or ferruled conductors.

Fast Installation
All ECO Power Supplies have a flat and very robust DIN rail mount metal housing. Mounting is simple, thanks to a readily accessible plate on the device.

Clear Indication
All ECO Power Supplies indicate output voltage availability via green LED. A red LED indicates an overvoltage. This simplifies start-up and quickly provides maintenance personnel with system or machine status.

High Load-Carrying Capacity
ECO Power Supplies detect overload from 1.15x nominal output current. The units can be overloaded up to 1.4x the nominal current. The output voltage is considerably reduced if the overload continuous rising. In case of a low-resistance short-circuit, the output will be switched off. As soon as the short circuit has been removed, the output will automatically reactivate.

Universal Supply
The wide range of input voltages ECO Power Supplies allows feeds of 85 to 264Vac  mass-produced machines can operate on different supply networks in Europe, America or Asia without additional conversion or setting. This feature increases tolerance of voltage fluctuations within a supply network, increasing reliability.

This integrated battery monitor shares information about the battery bank with other MasterBus, CZone or NMEA 2000 enabled devices such as battery chargers, inverter/chargers and displays. No surprises: allowing complete automation of your system, MasterShunt improves comfort, prolongs battery life and extends your runtime.

The MasterShunt 500 provides all information needed for monitoring your battery bank and control of your system, such as voltage, current, state of charge and time remaining. All information is made available to the system by a single MasterBus or CZone cable. Extremely accurate measurement of current flow over state of charge enables the MasterShunt to precisely determine the time remaining.

Programmable events and an integrated real time clock make it possible to fully automate your system. Examples are to start your generator automatically when the battery bank is low (or just delaying at night!), or to automatically generate a warning at a certain depth of discharge. The proven MasterShunt design has been upgraded to obtain an even higher level of accuracy and control. Taking into account battery specific parameters, MasterShunt takes reading accuracy to a whole new level.

The MasterShunt 500 CZone allows freedom of choice with regards to fuse type, rating and location. The battery monitor is supplied with an internal bus bar, to be used in situations where an external fuse holder is selected. In case the MasterShunt is installed close to the battery, the bus bar may be replaced by either an ANL type or Class T main fuse, saving both space and cost.
